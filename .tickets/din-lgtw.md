# auto containers resolve their axis from two different rectangles

Workspace.axisOfContainer and the layout use frames after minimum sizes; resize (DinkyLayout/Commands.swift) and edgeWindow (Workspace.swift) use root.rect(at:) from ratios alone. An auto container near square with a minimum-size window can read as horizontal in one and vertical in the other. Found by the refactor pass on 26 September.

## Acceptance Criteria

One rectangle source for auto resolution, with a test for the near-square-with-minimum case.
