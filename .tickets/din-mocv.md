# move-window-to-workspace --follow leaves the moved window unfocused

After move-window-to-workspace N --follow the display is on N with the moved window there, but Finder is the front app and no window is focused (list-windows --focused: 'no window is focused'). macOS activates Finder when the source Space loses the active app's last window, and windowMoved(refocus: false) does not focus the moved window after the switch lands.

Reproduction (VM): workspace 3; open -a TextEdit a.txt (only window there); move-window-to-workspace 4 --follow; sleep 1.5; list-windows --focused -> 'no window is focused', front app Finder.

Idea: when following, focus the moved window once the swipe lands (SpaceSwitcher completion).
